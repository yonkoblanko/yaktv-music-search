REAME

YAKTV MUSIC SEARCH is a music search engime that provides a tracks name, album, image url and track name upon entering in the search box a musicians track name to help you find various information. YAKTV stands for YOU ALREADY KNOW THE VIBES and the site was developed by Justin Camacho for his SEI bootcamp program and this is v1 of the application. The developer plans to make other changes and add more features in due time but this is a working application designed help individuals find the artist and album name as well as provide a link to a image source to see visually who and what it is the requested search item can render.
